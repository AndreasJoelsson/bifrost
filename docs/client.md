## Client Module

The Client module in the Bifrost Gateway project provides interfaces and implementations for client-side interactions with the gateway. It's designed to facilitate operations related to S3 buckets, such as uploading objects. Here's an in-depth look at the key components:

### ObjectClient Interface

The `ObjectClient` interface defines the contract for client-side interactions with the gateway. Although the code is currently commented out, it appears to define methods for:

- **Uploading Objects**: Specifies methods for uploading objects to S3 buckets, including handling multiple files and different media types.

### S3GatewayObjectClient Class

The `S3GatewayObjectClient` class implements the `ObjectClient` interface and provides specific functionalities for interacting with S3 buckets using Minio. The code is currently commented out, but it appears to include:

- **S3 Service**: Utilizes an S3 service for handling interactions with S3 buckets.
- **Uploading Objects**: Implements methods for uploading objects to specific buckets and paths, including handling multiple files.
- **Status Handling**: Determines the upload status, returning either `UPLOADED` or `FAILED` based on the HTTP status value.

### Conclusion

The Client module plays a vital role in the Bifrost Gateway project, providing the necessary interfaces and implementations for client-side interactions. Although the code is currently commented out, it offers a glimpse into the intended functionalities for handling S3 objects and related operations.

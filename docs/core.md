## Core Module

The Core module is the backbone of the Bifrost Gateway, providing essential functionalities, configurations, and services that support the overall operation of the system. Here's an in-depth look at the key components:

### Context Interface

The Context Interface serves as a central point for defining methods related to publishing objects to specific targets. It includes methods for:

- **Configuration Retrieval**: Accessing the current configuration settings.
- **Publishing Files**: Handling the publishing of files, including various media types and input streams.
- **Response Handling**: Structuring the response based on the publishing outcome.

### Services

The Core module includes services that define the behavior and interaction with S3 buckets. Key services include:

#### S3 Service Using Minio

This service provides an implementation for interacting with S3 buckets using Minio. It includes functionalities for:

- **Data Publishing**: Handling the publishing of data to specific targets.
- **Configuration**: Managing the configuration settings for S3 interactions.
- **Response Handling**: Structuring the response based on the publishing outcome.

#### S3 Service Local Filesystem

An alternative service that allows interaction with the local filesystem as if it were an S3 bucket. It includes similar functionalities to the Minio-based service but operates on the local filesystem.

### Configuration Classes

The Core module includes classes for loading and managing configuration settings, such as:

- **Config Loader**: Responsible for loading configuration settings from specified files or resources.
- **S3 Config**: Defines the configuration settings specific to S3 interactions, including implementation types and target configurations.

### Conclusion

The Core module is vital to the Bifrost Gateway, providing the underlying functionalities and services that enable smooth interaction with S3 buckets and other targets. With a flexible design and robust implementation, it ensures that the gateway can adapt to various requirements and provide consistent performance.
